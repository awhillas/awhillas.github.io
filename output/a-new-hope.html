    <p>So I have decided to start this blog up again to track my (side)
development effort. I have been working on a few things lately and I
think it would be good to document them here.</p>

<p>I’m interested in Rust as I predict it will overtake C++ in
popularity within the next 2-3 years if the trends in the above graph
from <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=c%2B%2B%2Crust">Stackoverflow
Trends</a> continues. Rust is growing in popularity exponentially and
C++ seems to have a linear decline.</p>
<p>The reasons for this, I think, are many.</p>
<p>Rust has a built in package manager which also handles compilation
and makes the developer experience easy, and convenient always triumphs
difficult. This is a huge boon to productivity and also a huge breath of
fresh air after C++. It took me about 6 weeks to get started with C++
(finding a package manager amongst many, trying to understand CMake). I
think what is happening is young<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, C++ developers are
trying Rust and then being won over by this after struggling through
C++.</p>
<p>Rust has a lot of modern language features like, what JavaScript
would call “promises”. And they are used consistently and everywhere
within the standard lib. Some C++ people say that the syntax is
horrible, but its just different and I find it more concise and not
littered with as much noise as C++.</p>

<p>No native linear algebra libraries or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/smdl3m/rust_and_scientifichighperformance_computing/">Scientific/High-Performance
Computing</a> (HPC). It does have bindings for OpenBLAS a C++ lib but
its apparently a nightmare to get working cross platform. This holds it
back from deep learning and general data science which both rely heavily
on matrix operations.</p>
<p>But its still early days and I think these issues will be address in
time.</p>
