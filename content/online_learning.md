In the Machine Learning Street Talk podcast's episode on 'Consciousness In The [Chinese Room](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chinese_room)', Francois Chollet's [criticism of the thought experiment](https://youtu.be/_KVAzAzO5HU?t=979) struck me

> of course the person executing the rules does not understand Chinese, that's not where you would expect understanding to be located in the system. Understanding is an imagined property of the information processing system as a whole. Understanding is not in the instructions themselves it's not in the processor that executes the instructions it's in the functional dynamics of how the input information is being processed by the instructions.

He goes on to say that he believes the Chinese Room does not understand even if you are looking at the information processing system as a whole its because the book is static, or a crystallized skill, it can not adapt to changing circumstances

> skill at a task is not sufficient to assert understanding of a task... intelligence is characterized by the ability to learn and adapt and efficiently pick up new skills from experience

> If you understand what you're doing then you can adapt what you're doing when the world changes you can learn and adapt and improve and if you don't understand what you're doing then you're stuck with a static skill and that's really how you tell the difference between understanding and not understanding

This made me think of what used to be called "online learning" or real-time learning[^online].

So now I'm interested in doing some experiments with basic simulations, with neural networks that update their weights in real time and see where that leads. This is why I'm [learning Rust]({filename}/a-new-hope.md) incidentally.

[^online]: "Real-time" might be a better term as "online" implies the internet these days.
