    <p>In the Machine Learning Street Talk podcast’s episode on
‘Consciousness In The <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chinese_room">Chinese Room</a>’,
Francois Chollet’s <a href="https://youtu.be/_KVAzAzO5HU?t=979">criticism of the thought
experiment</a> struck me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>of course the person executing the rules does not understand Chinese,
that’s not where you would expect understanding to be located in the
system. Understanding is an imagined property of the information
processing system as a whole. Understanding is not into instructions
themselves it’s not in the processor that executes the instructions it’s
in the functional dynamics of how the input information is being
processed by the instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to say that he believes the Chinese Room does not
understand even if you are looking at the information processing system
as a whole its because the book is static, or a crystallized skill, it
can not adapt to changing circumstances</p>
<blockquote>
<p>skill at a task is not sufficient to assert understanding of a task…
intelligence is characterized by the ability to learn and adapt and
efficiently pick up new skills from experience</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you understand what you’re doing then you can adapt what you’re
doing when the world changes you can learn and adapt and improve and if
you don’t understand what you’re doing then you’re stuck with a static
skill and that’s really how you tell the difference between
understanding and not understanding</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me think of what used to be called “online learning” or
real-time learning<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>So now I’m interested in doing some experiments with basic
simulations, with neural networks that update their weights in real time
and see where that leads. This is why I’m <a href="/a-new-hope.html">learning Rust</a> incidently.</p>
