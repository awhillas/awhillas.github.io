            <h1>2nd April, 2024 - Hypermodel</h1>
<p>Going to go with a Level 2 hypermodel using <code>[fastapi-hypermodel](https://jtc42.github.io/fastapi-hypermodel/)</code> which is&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FastAPI-HyperModel is a FastAPI + Pydantic extension for simplifying hypermedia-driven API development.
Hypermedia consist of enriching API responses by providing links to other <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</abbr> within the services to fetch related resources or perform certain actions. There are several levels according to the <a href="https://8thlight.com/insights/the-hypermedia-maturity-model">Hypermedia Maturity Model Levels</a>. Using Hypermedia makes APIs reach Level 3 of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_Maturity_Model">Richardson Maturity Model (RMM)</a>, which involves leveraging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS)</a>, that is, Hypermedia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This basically allows me to define media types and exposed hyperlinks (<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</abbr>) to perform all the actions on those media types. It has the equivalent of HTML forms but in JSON if those actions or mutations need more information. This should allow me to keep the React <abbr title="frontend">FE</abbr> fairly generic which was the idea of the <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr> principles. If I take it all the way to RMM Level 3 it even has all the RDF stuff so people can expose the data to the public and do real linked data.</p>
<h1>1st April, 2024 - No Fooling</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on, what I call Headspace<sup id="fnref:headspace"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:headspace">1</a></sup> (working tittle), for about 3 months. I imagine it as a virtual space in which you can organise your ideas, various types of data and interface with AI models on the backend with a click of a button. Kind of a cross between a virtual whiteboard and a database knitted together with RDF metadata.gi</p>
<h2>Brief history of the idea</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this idea knocking around inside my head for about&hellip; 20 years. At first it wasn&rsquo;t feasible with the <abbr title="State of The Art">SoTA</abbr><sup id="fnref:sota"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sota">2</a></sup> in frontend development being JQuery and SVG being a standard that perhaps one browser supported (Flash was what everyone was using for vector graphics).</p>
<h2><abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr> is HATEOAS?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST"><abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr></a>ful APIs for awhile, or at least I thought I did. <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr> actually has a few constraints, according to its originator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding">Roy Fielding</a> in his <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">PhD thesis</a> (he gets to the crunch in chapter 5 and 6), that are about long term think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr> is software design on the scale of decades: every detail is intended to promote software longevity and independent evolution. Many of the constraints are directly opposed to short-term efficiency. Unfortunately, people are fairly good at short-term design, and usually awful at long-term design. - <a href="https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">cite</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS#:~:text=Hypermedia%20as%20the%20engine%20of,provide%20information%20dynamically%20through%20hypermedia.">Hypertext as The Engine of Application State</a> (HaTEoAS) &ldquo;is a constraint of the <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr> application architecture that distinguishes it from other network application architectures.&rdquo; according to Roy Fielding its creator, which he outlines in his doctorial thesis. This gives us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The strong decoupling of client and server together with the text-based transfer of information using a uniform addressing protocol provided the basis for meeting the requirements of the Web: robustness (anarchic scalability), independent deployment of components, large-grain data transfer, and a low entry-barrier for content readers, content authors and developers alike.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the long and short of it is: have hyperlinks (<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</abbr> related to the thing/data you are looking at) accompany media. These <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</abbr> are for navigating and mutating the state of the media you are looking at. The links can be labelled with relations. The only problems with this last part is that those are domain specific and so you need a human to interpret them, well until <abbr title="Large Language Models, i.e ChatGPT, M$'s Copilot etc">LLM</abbr>. There has been an attempt to make some standard relations. But this is all good as this is exactly what I need for Headspace as the relations need only have good human readable descriptions for the React client/frontend/Code-on-Demand to display to the user, and these relations are going to be different of each media type, as Mr Fielding intended!</p>
