<p>Its always good to make decision based on data.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph from Stackoverflow Trends. Extrapolate the lines..." src="/images/cpp_vs_rust_2023.svg" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in Rust as I predict it will overtake C++ in popularity within the next 1-2 years if the trends in the above graph from <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=c%2B%2B%2Crust">Stackoverflow Trends</a> continues. Rust is growing in popularity exponentially and C++ seems to have a linear decline.</p>
<p>The reasons for this, I think, are many.</p>
<p>Rust has a built in package manager which also handles compilation and makes the developer experience easy. Easy always trumps difficult, every time<sup id="fnref:everytime"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:everytime">2</a></sup>. This is a huge boon to productivity and also a huge breath of fresh air after C++. It took me about 6 weeks to get started with C++ (finding a package manager amongst many, trying to understand CMake). I think what is happening is young<sup id="fnref:young"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:young">1</a></sup>, C++ developers are trying Rust and then being won over by this after struggling through C++.</p>
<p>Rust has a lot of modern language features like, what JavaScript would call &ldquo;promises&rdquo;. And they are used consistently and everywhere within the standard lib. Some C++ people say that the syntax is horrible, but its just different and I find it more concise and not littered with as much noise as C++.</p>

<p><img alt="C++ vs Rust meme" src="/images/cpp_vs_rust_meme.png" /></p>
<p>No native linear algebra libraries or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/smdl3m/rust_and_scientifichighperformance_computing/">Scientific/High-Performance Computing</a> (HPC). It does have bindings for OpenBLAS a C++ lib but its apparently a nightmare to get working cross platform. This holds it back from deep learning and general data science which both rely heavily on matrix operations.</p>
<p>But its still early days and I think these issues will be address in time.</p>
<h1 id="but-how">But How?<a class="headerlink" href="#but-how" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Here are some materials I&rsquo;ve been using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8">The Rust Lang Book video series</a> is quite handy to get up to speed on Rust quickly. Its basically going over the official <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language Book</a> which takes you through all the features of Rust in a systematic way. I find someone going over the material (at double speed) seems to be easier than reading the material directly. But its not enough by itself. Need to apply what I&rsquo;ve learning quickly or else it doesn&rsquo;t sink in.<ul>
<li>There is also an interactive <a href="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/">quiz based</a> leaning aid that I just discovered while writing this. I have never been into puzzels that much but I know if you don&rsquo;t try to apply what you have just learnt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVnntJRoP85JHGX7rGDu6LaF3fmDDbqyd">Learn Bevy Engine 0.10 Beginner Tutorial Series</a> <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> is an <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Entity_component_system">ECS</a> game system. ECS are all the range in game development because they are fast because they take advantage of CPU caching. This tutorial series takes you from zero to build a basic interactive game and give you a template for your own project. Although I&rsquo;m not familiar will all of Rust&rsquo;s syntax I find learning by doing the best strategy. I&rsquo;ve just finished the first 10 episodes which is all there is at this time. Time to make my first game with this template.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-steps">First steps<a class="headerlink" href="#first-steps" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Some projects I&rsquo;m thinking of starting or have started in current order of enthusiasm:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/alphabetica-game-dev-log.html">Alphabetica Game</a> - My son is learning to read at the moment and I think a game to help him match letters to sounds might help. Repetition is the key. I&rsquo;m going to build it off the back of the Bevy tutorial I&rsquo;ve been going through.</li>
<li><a href="/realtime-machine-learning.html">Online Machine Learning</a> - I&rsquo;ve seen some simple simulations on YouTube where people evolve neural networks (NN) to operate, embodied in a simple simulated environment. I want to do something similar but I want to do online/real-time training of the NN. I think this will lead to a more aware AI.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/awhillas/check">Chess engine</a> - or now I&rsquo;m thinking, rather a general purpose discreet, game engine. Create an interface to some set of rules which generate moves for a given position (and also indicate a winning move/position) it should be able to learn via self-play. I guess replicating AlphaZero would be the first step?</li>
<li><a href="/solid-pod-server.html">Solid Pod Server</a> - all in one identity/public+private content server with built in authorization (OAuth+). The hard part of Solid, because it was very boring, was trying to understand the standards which are verbose and incomplete. It also uses OAuth + OpenID Connect at the core of its authorization protocol which in itself was the hardest part, because its complicated and I found it hard to find a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=oauth2+flow">straight forward explanation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Cave Boy</strong>, a kids, open-world, adventure game. I&rsquo;ve started <a href="https://github.com/awhillas/caveboy">prototyping in Python</a>. I&rsquo;m thinking something like Don&rsquo;t Starve (but less scary), or Stardew valley (with less detail) with a Captain Underpants sense of humour (i.e. potty). I&rsquo;m thinking to aim it for 4-8 year olds, full touch screen and very simple mechanics. Everything is visually displayed at all times (no hidden menus or state i.e. inventory). TODO: break this out into a full blog post (i will as I get more into it). I have some concept art already!</li>
</ul>
