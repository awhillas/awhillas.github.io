<p>Its always good to make decision based on data.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph from Stackoverflow Trends. Extrapolate the lines..." src="/images/cpp_vs_rust_2023.svg" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in Rust as I predict it will overtake C++ in popularity within the next 1-2 years if the trends in the above graph from <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=c%2B%2B%2Crust">Stackoverflow Trends</a> continues. Rust is growing in popularity exponentially and C++ seems to have a linear decline.</p>
<p>The reasons for this, I think, are many.</p>
<p>Rust has a built in package manager which also handles compilation and makes the developer experience easy. Easy always trumps difficult, every time<sup id="fnref:everytime"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:everytime">2</a></sup>. This is a huge boon to productivity and also a huge breath of fresh air after C++. It took me about 6 weeks to get started with C++ (finding a package manager amongst many, trying to understand CMake). I think what is happening is young<sup id="fnref:young"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:young">1</a></sup>, C++ developers are trying Rust and then being won over by this after struggling through C++.</p>
<p>Rust has a lot of modern language features like, what JavaScript would call &ldquo;promises&rdquo;. And they are used consistently and everywhere within the standard lib. Some C++ people say that the syntax is horrible, but its just different and I find it more concise and not littered with as much noise as C++.</p>

<p>No native linear algebra libraries or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/smdl3m/rust_and_scientifichighperformance_computing/">Scientific/High-Performance Computing</a> (HPC). It does have bindings for OpenBLAS a C++ lib but its apparently a nightmare to get working cross platform. This holds it back from deep learning and general data science which both rely heavily on matrix operations.</p>
<p>But its still early days and I think these issues will be address in time.</p>

<p>The average age of C++ devs is over 40 these days, see <a href="https://isocpp.org/files/papers/CppDevSurvey-2022-summary.pdf">Q2 and Q3</a>, also Q6 notes the major pain point is &ldquo;Managing libraries my application depends on&rdquo;.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:young" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
