<p>Its always good to make decision based on data.</p>
<p><img alt="Graph from Stackoverflow Trends. Extrapolate the lines..." src="/images/cpp_vs_rust_2023.svg" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in Rust as I predict it will overtake C++ in popularity within the next 1-2 years if the trends in the above graph from <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=c%2B%2B%2Crust">Stackoverflow Trends</a> continues. Rust is growing in popularity exponentially and C++ seems to have a linear decline.</p>
<p>The reasons for this, I think, are many.</p>
<p>Rust has a built in package manager which also handles compilation and makes the developer experience easy. Easy always trumps difficult, every time<sup id="fnref:everytime"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:everytime">2</a></sup>. This is a huge boon to productivity and also a huge breath of fresh air after C++. It took me about 6 weeks to get started with C++ (finding a package manager amongst many, trying to understand CMake). I think what is happening is young<sup id="fnref:young"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:young">1</a></sup>, C++ developers are trying Rust and then being won over by this after struggling through C++.</p>
<p>Rust has a lot of modern language features like, what JavaScript would call &ldquo;promises&rdquo;. And they are used consistently and everywhere within the standard lib. Some C++ people say that the syntax is horrible, but its just different and I find it more concise and not littered with as much noise as C++.</p>

<p><img alt="C++ vs Rust meme" src="/images/cpp_vs_rust_meme.png" /></p>
<p>No native linear algebra libraries or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/smdl3m/rust_and_scientifichighperformance_computing/">Scientific/High-Performance Computing</a> (HPC). It does have bindings for OpenBLAS a C++ lib but its apparently a nightmare to get working cross platform. This holds it back from deep learning and general data science which both rely heavily on matrix operations.</p>
<p>But its still early days and I think these issues will be address in time.</p>
<h2 id="first-steps">First steps<a class="headerlink" href="#first-steps" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Some projects I&rsquo;m thinking of starting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/awhillas/check">Chess engine</a> - or now I&rsquo;m thinking, rather a general purpose discreet, game engine. Create an interface to some set of rules which generate moves for a given position (and also indicate a winning move/position) it should be able to learn via self-play. I guess replicating AlphaZero would be the first step?</li>
<li>Kids, open-world, adventure game. I&rsquo;ve started <a href="https://github.com/awhillas/caveboy">prototyping in Python</a>. I&rsquo;m thinking something like Don&rsquo;t Starve (but less scary), or Stardew valley (with less detail). I&rsquo;m thinking to aim it for 4-8 year olds, full touch screen and very simple mechanics. Everything is visually displayed at all times (no hidden menus or state i.e. inventory). I was going to call it Cave Boy. Have been looking at <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a>, an <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Entity_component_system">ECS</a> game system which is fairly advanced. Bevy does have a hard time with vector graphics but apparently you can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bevy/comments/131eryb/ecs_without_the_rest/">use the ECS system without the rest</a>.</li>
