            <h2>29 June, 2023 - Research time</h2>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve hit the point in which I&rsquo;ve run out of things to code and need to do some research and design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>phonemic awareness performance can predict literacy performance more accurately than variables such as intelligence, vocabulary knowledge, and socioeconomic status<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The good news is that phonological awareness is one of the few factors that teachers are able to influence significantly through instructionâ€”unlike intelligence, vocabulary, and socioeconomic status <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. <a href="https://www.readnaturally.com/research/5-components-of-reading/phonological-awareness#:~:text=Phonological%20Awareness%20Skills,onset%2Drime%2C%20and%20phoneme.">cite</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Phonological Awareness Skills" src="http://alexander.whillas.com/images/Phonological_Awareness_Skills.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blending phonemes into words and segmenting words into phonemes contribute directly to learning to read and spell well. In fact, these two phonemic awareness skills contribute more to learning to read and spell well than any of the other activities under the phonological awareness umbrella. <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So blending phonemes into words and segmenting words into phonemes are the main objectives of this project.</p>
<h2>26 June, 2023 - Pivot (again) to Kivy</h2>
<p>So while setting up pygame, which is really going back to basics, I was reminded of <a href="https://kivy.org/">Kivy</a> which is designed to make user interfaces. Another issue with pygame is that it is difficult to compile for iOS, and that is a target of this project i.e. touch screens are what I&rsquo;m designing for, and Kivy makes his easy out of the box.</p>
<p>The only problem with Kivy is that its model is a but opaque and the documentation is in various stages of freshness. The API documentation seems up to date but doesn&rsquo;t have so many examples of common use cases and the tutorials are over a decade old. There are <a href="https://github.com/kivy/kivy/tree/master/examples">examples</a> that I have yet to delve into, most of them are pushing a decade old as well.</p>
<h3>On the Bevy front</h3>
<p>I did a little experiment on Friday. I had a question that I posted in three places, the <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/8919">bevy github discussion</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76527423/how-to-get-the-actual-pixel-size-of-a-transformed-sprite-in-bevy">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/14fkzwk/how_to_get_the_actual_pixel_size_of_a_transformed/?sort=new">r/rust_gamedev</a>. The only one that got a reply and indeed and answer was Reddit (took 3 days). I think that Reddit works so well because developers go there for many reasons, news; gossip; ideas and help, all mixed together. So if you need help you have the highest chance the person with the answer&rsquo;s eyeballs will see your post. Since the other two are just help support, people are less likely to look there. There is a threaded Help channel in the Discord that I didn&rsquo;t look at which seems active, I&rsquo;ll try that next time.</p>
<p>So anyway the answer was you have to figure out scaling stuff yourself but you can get the info in the Transform:</p>

<p>So since I got an answer I might persevere with it a bit longer.</p>
<h3>New Strategy</h3>
<p>I might do two versions of the project at the same time. Since it takes soooooo loooong to get Bev answers I&rsquo;ll work in Bevy until I hit a blocker, ask a question and then swtich to Kivy until I hot a blocker and then switch back again. I really want to learn Rust and I don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth to learn it separately from the one side project I do have time for so I&rsquo;ll keep tyring to shoehorn it in.</p>
<h2>23 June, 2023 - Pivot to pygame</h2>
<p>So as much as I like the setup of Bevy&rsquo;s ECS I hit a major road block and can&rsquo;t get any help on it. I basically want to get the pixel size of a scaled image and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any way to do that in Bevy. I think because transforms are in WebGPU (WGPU) and Bevy its a one way street with from Bevy to WGPU.</p>
<p>I found a hard time getting help with this as the Bevy subreddit has been taken down due the the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/06/what-reddit-got-wrong?utm_source=pocket_saves">Reddit hullabaloo</a> that is going on. The moderator didn&rsquo;t bother with a transition period so there is nowhere to ask questions. I tried posting the same question on the <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/8919">bevy&rsquo;s github discussion board</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/14fkzwk/how_to_get_the_actual_pixel_size_of_a_transformed/">/r/rust_gamedev</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76527423/how-to-get-the-actual-pixel-size-of-a-transformed-sprite-in-bevy">Stack Overflow</a> to see which one would get a response but so far nada.</p>
<p>In the mean time my son needs some help with reading so I&rsquo;m going to pivot to pygame as I know I can bag out something fast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll learn Rust on one of my other side projects. I think approaching it from the other side, see what low hanging fruit there is a and make a game around it rather than fighting Bevy to do something specific. There is a <a href="https://github.com/dimforge/salva">fluid simulation lib</a> I found (which is based on a good, <a href="https://nalgebra.org/">pure Rust linear algebra lib</a>) which would be fun for kids as they love water parks especially sandpits with water!</p>
<h3>Starting at the end</h3>
<p>So the first thing I want to do is figure out how to make a n executable from my python script so I can CI/CD all the time and have it playable on 3 OSes (not sure if i get it working on MacOS if that will work on an iPad as that would be a great market). There are two options I can see <a href="https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/">pyInstaller</a> and <a href="https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">cx_Freeze</a>. In both cases you need to run their build on the target OS.</p>
<h2>15th June, 2023 - Sound problems</h2>
<p>SO I have the button on the screen and it makes a sound when you press it. If you smash the button, which 5yos will do, it triggers so much that I fear the app will crash. I thought to try and fix this by installing a Bevy Kira extension but it very difficult to install. Will ask on some forums how to get it going. Don&rsquo;t want to lose momentum so I&rsquo;ll just use the built in stuff. Sound always plays second fiddle to graphics in games.</p>
<p>Next I need to investigate <a href="https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/programming/events.html">events</a> in Bevy and get the letters spawning when the button is pressed. I&rsquo;m thinking SVG for letters so I can go crazy with fonts.</p>
<h3>Bevy Events</h3>
<p>There are pretty simple. Four steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a plain public struct for the event</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">pub</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="nc">MyEvent</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{};</span>

<h2>13th June, 2023 - First steps</h2>
<p>So after watching a few game dev videos on YouTube about indie success stories, they seem to recommend keeping a game dev log to help with motivation. So here I am.</p>
<p>My son is five and a half and beginning to learn to read. Tonight actually he spelt out the word &lsquo;wash&rsquo; in a Sesame Street book I was reading him to my amazement. I wanted to make a game for him to help him with the sounding out of letters and ultimately help him to sound out letters. My only fear is that it will take too long and he wont need it by the time I finish.</p>
<p>I did start to look into phonetics and phenomes, there are 44 in the English language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phonemes are taught as part of the Phonics Phases 1-6 and are a key method in helping children learn how to read. Phonics links phonemes, or the sounds, with the graphemes, or letters, they represent.
<a href="https://www.twinkl.co.nz/teaching-wiki/phoneme">cite</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Sound</h3>
<p>I found this great video of a woman sounding out each of them.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUCUhHUDZIY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I downloaded the video, extracted the sound, converted it to WAV, used Audacity to cut it up into individual voicings and then had to convert them to Ogg Vorbis audio format because I couldn&rsquo;t find any documentation on what audio types Bevy accepts out of the box other than the example of <code>.ogg</code> files. I still have to go through all of them and name them something useful. There are 4 soundings of each phoneme and a word example for each.</p>
<h3>Fonts!</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d forgotten how much fun fonts can be! Its going to be easy to give letters character using different fonts.</p>
<h3>Follow the fun</h3>
<p>But how to make it fun? I have a very basic idea of what I&rsquo;m going to start with and hope by getting my son to play test it I can figure out what he likes about it a follow that. I saw a video by <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sid_Meier">Sid Meier</a> (Sim City, The Sims) on Master Class about making games and his advise was to prototype ideas fast and test them for fun. You wont always know until you play what mechanic/dynamic will be the fun part. &ldquo;Follow the fun!&rdquo;.</p>
