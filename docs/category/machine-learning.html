                <p>In the Machine Learning Street Talk podcast&rsquo;s episode on &lsquo;Consciousness In The <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chinese_room">Chinese Room</a>&rsquo;, Francois Chollet&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/_KVAzAzO5HU?t=979">criticism of the thought experiment</a> struck me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>of course the person executing the rules does not understand Chinese, that&rsquo;s not where you would expect understanding to be located in the system. Understanding is an imagined property of the information processing system as a whole. Understanding is not in the instructions themselves it&rsquo;s not in the processor that executes the instructions it&rsquo;s in the functional dynamics of how the input information is being processed by the instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to say that he believes the Chinese Room does not understand even if you are looking at the information processing system as a whole its because the book is static, or a crystallized skill, it can not adapt to changing circumstances</p>
<blockquote>
<p>skill at a task is not sufficient to assert understanding of a task&hellip; intelligence is characterized by the ability to learn and adapt and efficiently pick up new skills from experience</p>
<p>If you understand what you&rsquo;re doing then you can adapt what you&rsquo;re doing when the world changes you can learn and adapt and improve and if you don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re doing then you&rsquo;re stuck with a static skill and that&rsquo;s really how you tell the difference between understanding and not understanding</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me think of what used to be called &ldquo;online learning&rdquo; or real-time learning<sup id="fnref:online"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:online">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m interested in doing some experiments with basic simulations, with neural networks that update their weights in real time and see where that leads. This is why I&rsquo;m <a href="/a-new-hope.html">learning Rust</a> incidentally.</p>
